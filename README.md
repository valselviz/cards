# Collectable Cards Game by Valeria Selviz

This is a project I created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a game about using your deck of cards to face and defeat an opponent.

Features:
- a vast pool of cards where each card has its own unique stats and special effects
- a basic opponent AI that allows a single player experience

Comming soon:
- deck management, where the player can add/remove cards to/from his deck
- card store, where the player can buy cards
- the game uses local-storage to allow players to keep their progress

## Available Scripts

To run the project execute:

### `npm run start`

Open it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To run the Jest tests execute:
